# evidx-alignment

(Following the EFFECT alignment repository)

This repository will contain the Karma models, frames, etc that can be made public.
No sample data should be added to this repo. It should be added to the effect-data repository.

The [dig-alignment](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/dig-alignment) repository will hold the ontologies, context and the python scripts.
You need to clone and checkout the **development** branch and set Karma home as `<clone folder>/dig-alignment/versions/3.0/karma/`. For  example: `/Users/usc/github/dig/dig-alignment/versions/3.0/karma/`

```
git clone https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/dig-alignment.git
git checkout development
```
